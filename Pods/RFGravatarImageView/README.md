RFGravatarImageView
====================

A simple UIImageView subclass for dealing with http://gravatar.com images.

##Installation

### Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like RFGravatarImageView in your projects.

#### Podfile

```ruby
platform :ios, '7.0'
pod "RFGravatarImageView", "~> 1.0"
```

### Installation without CocoaPods

Just drag the RFGravatarImageView folder into your project and import it.  You'll also have to download SDWebImage, which you can grab here: [SDWebImage repository](https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage).

```
#import 'RFGravatarImageView.h'
// Don't worry about importing SDWebImage
```

## Use

RFGravatarImageView is pretty easy to use.  See this example implementation (copy/paste from demo project).

```obj-c
_imageView = [[RFGravatarImageView alloc] initWithFrame:self.view.bounds];
[_imageView setEmail:@"rexcfinn@gmail.com"];
[_imageView setSize:1024];
    
[self.view addSubview:_imageView];
    
[_imageView loadGravatar];
```

See [RFGravatarImageView.h](RFGravatarImageView/RFGravatarImageView.h) to view each available method and the variables - I've commented on everything you need (I think).  For more information on the Gravatar image requests, see [here](https://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/images).

##Methods and Variables

```obj-c
// I suppose you could use an NSDictionary for this, but I was lazy - feel free to add.

// User email - you must set this!
@property (readwrite, strong, nonatomic) NSString *email;

// A placeholder image while SDWebImage fetches the gravatar.
@property (readwrite, strong, nonatomic) UIImage *placeholder;

// The size of the gravatar up to 2048. All gravatars are squares, so you will get 2048x2048.
@property (readwrite, nonatomic) NSUInteger size;

// Rating (G, PG, R, X) of gravatar to allow, helpful for kid-friendly apps.
@property (readwrite, nonatomic) GravatarRatings rating;

// If email doesn't have a gravatar, use one of these... http://bit.ly/1cCmtdb
@property (readwrite, nonatomic) DefaultGravatars defaultGravatar;

// Force a default gravatar, whether or not email has gravatar. Remember to set defaultGravatar too!
@property (readwrite, nonatomic) BOOL forceDefault;

// Another option to init with a placeholder, so you don't have to do [_imageView setPlaceholder:].
- (id)initWithFrame:(CGRect)frame andPlaceholder:(UIImage*)placeholder;

// A substitute to having to do [_imageView setForceDefault:YES]; and setting the default gravatar.
- (void)forceDefault:(BOOL)forceDefault withDefaultGravatar:(DefaultGravatars)gravatar;

// Actually loads the gravatar AFTER you have configured all of your options.
- (void)loadGravatar;

// Load gravatar with completion block
- (void)loadGravatar:(void (^)(void))completed;

// Refreshes the gravatar, you can set new paramters between loading it and refreshing it.
- (void)refreshGravatar;
```
